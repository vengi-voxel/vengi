# General

This is about an mmorpg in a fantasy like world.

The world is an active simulation where you "jump" into characters (ala Avatar). You inherit the characters
abilities while you are jumped in. You learn some of the abilities in your own profile and can keep the abilities
to some degree when you jump out of the character again.
You will also leave some of the abilities at the entity when you jump out again.

The world is divided by portals that connect islands. There is a max player amount on each island - limited by
the amount of characters you can jump into. Leaving an island just gives an overview of "free" other islands you
can travel to. And again you take your newly learned abilities with you - but not all of the characters'.

The entities in the island simulation have a profession where you can decide what to do with it when you jump in.
There is a value that indicates whether it's still reasonable to continue with that particular profession. If
the entity - for some reason - can't continue with the current job, that value decreases and the entity will try
to pick another free job.
Before quitting the job, the entity will report this as an impediment in the corresponding townhall as a quest
- asking for help.
