# Features

A few of the features are:

* Layer and key frame [animation](Animation.md) support
* Viewport screenshots and AVI video recording
* Customizable UI
* Multiple viewports to view the model from all sides while editing it
* Multi monitor support
* LUA [scripting](../LUAScript.md) api and built-in editor
* Undo/Redo
* Network mode
* Copy/Cut/Paste - paste to cursor or reference position
* Layer and scene graph support
* Custom color palettes with sorting and several color reduction algorithms
* Custom key bindings
* Import images as heightmaps, palettes or planes
* Import meshes and voxelize them - see [supported formats](../Formats.md)
* Import whole folders of single models into one scene
* Exporting single models or whole scenes into meshes and a lot of other formats
* Voxelize true type font text
* Procedurally generated content like trees and a L-System integration
* Generate level of details (LOD) volumes
* Cropping volumes
* Online asset browsing for voxel repositories
* Presentation mode for e.g. kitbashing sets
* Several editing brushes are available
* Not only voxels but also named points are supported as scene graph nodes - for e.g. defining positions for characters to hold an item.
* Calculating normals for voxels (non-hollow models) is supported, too. This is useful for some games like Command & Conquer.
* View modes for animation, Command & Conquer, Ace Of Spades or simple voxel editing

There are a lot more features to explore and this list is definitely not complete.
