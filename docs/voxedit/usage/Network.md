# Network

You can start a server to allow others to work on the same scene with you. Head over to the network panel in vengi-voxedit and start a server. Pick the proper interface to bind on. This is usually `0.0.0.0` if you want to have it opened globally. Make sure to open the specified port in your firewall/router. Now clients can connect.
