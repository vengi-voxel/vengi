# Network

You can start a server to allow others to work on the same scene with you. Head over to the network panel in vengi-voxedit and start a server. Pick the proper interface to bind on. This is usually `0.0.0.0` if you want to have it opened globally. Make sure to open the specified port in your firewall/router. Now clients can connect.

## Remote console access

In order to prevent running [commands](../../Configuration.md) on the server, you should make sure to set a remote console password. The client can now use the input field in the network panel to run commands on the server side.
