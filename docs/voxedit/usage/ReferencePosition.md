# Reference position

The current reference position is rendered as a blue dot in the scene (__in edit mode__) and is used to e.g. define the position the some [brushes](Brushes.md) are using (the line or path brush e.g.). It is also used to define the position of where to paste your clipboard at.

The reference position can be set by pressing `enter` while hovering a particular voxel - or by using the command `setreferenceposition` - see [controls](../Controls.md).
