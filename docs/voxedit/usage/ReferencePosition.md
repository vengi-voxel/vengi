# Reference position

The current reference position is rendered as a blue dot in the scene (__in edit mode__) and is used to e.g. define the position of where to put procedurally generated content like the trees. It is also used to define the position of where to paste your clipboard at. But also some modifier are using the reference position.

The reference position can be set by pressing enter while hovering a particular voxel - or by using the command `setreferenceposition` - see [controls](../Controls.md).
