# Scripts

![voxedit-scripts](../../img/voxedit-scripts.png)

Here you can execute the [lua scripts](../../LUAScript.md) in the editor to modify your scene or the current active volume (depends on the script).

The arguments given in the script are visualized here. This allows you to extend the script panel with your own fields to execute the scripts.
