# Modifiers

The available brushes support several modifiers.

## Place

Place new voxels in your volume.

## Erase

Erase voxels from your volume. There is a shortcut when you are in the other modes to delete voxels: Press the right mouse button (at least in the default binding).

## Override

Override existing voxels with a new color - but also place new voxels.

## Paint

Other than **override** this modifier only changes the color of existing voxels.
