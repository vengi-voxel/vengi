# Scene and edit mode

The __scene__ mode is for animating and moving objects in the world - while the __edit__ mode is for modifying voxels in the volumes.

The __edit__ mode can also bring the voxels into the final position by applying the transform values like translation, rotation and scale, too.

You can toggle between those modes by pressing the `tab` key in the default binding mode. See [controls](../Controls.md).

You can different [commands](../../Configuration.md) and actions to the same keys in __scene__ or __edit__ mode. Check our the [controls](../Controls.md) for more details.
