# View modes

There are several view modes available - most of them will change the layout and/or options that are available in the ui. There is e.g. a Command & Conquer mode where you can manage the normals that are part of the [vxl](../../Formats.md).

Artists that only want to edit voxels without animating them might use the simple layout to get a less complex ui.
