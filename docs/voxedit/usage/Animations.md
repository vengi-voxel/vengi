## Timeline

The timeline visualized the key frames for each node for each animation.

## Cameras

You can also animate cameras to fly through your scene. Simply select the __camera__ node in the scene graph panel and set the keyframes in the timeline. Once you have the camera activated, you can simply press play to fly through your scene.
