# Game mode

The voxel editor has a built-in game mode that allows you to walk your scene in first person mode. You can tweak the player height, jump velocity and so on to mimic your own game behaviour - or simply enjoying walking through your own scene.

While you are in first person game mode, you can still place voxels in [edit](SceneAndEditMode.md) mode.
