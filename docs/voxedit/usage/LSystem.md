# LSystem

![voxedit-lsystem](../../img/voxedit-lsystem.png)

The L-System (Lindenmayer System) generator allows you to create complex procedural structures like trees, bushes, and other organic shapes using a set of rules and parameters.

## Parameters

* **Axiom**: The initial state string (the seed) of the L-System.
* **Rules**: A list of production rules that define how symbols are replaced in each iteration.
    * **Predecessor**: The character to replace.
    * **Successor**: The string to replace the predecessor with.
* **Angle**: The angle in degrees for rotation commands.
* **Length**: The length of the segments drawn by the turtle.
* **Width**: The initial width of the segments.
* **Width increment**: The amount to increment or decrement the width when using width commands.
* **Iterations**: The number of times the rules are applied to the axiom. Higher values create more complex structures but take longer to generate.
* **Leaves radius**: The radius of the leaves generated by the 'L' command.

## Commands

The L-System uses a "turtle" graphics approach where a cursor moves through 3D space following these commands:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `F` | Draw line forwards |
| `(` | Set voxel type |
| `b` | Move backwards (no drawing) |
| `L` | Generate a leaf |
| `+` | Rotate right |
| `-` | Rotate left |
| `>` | Rotate forward |
| `<` | Rotate back |
| `#` | Increment width |
| `!` | Decrement width |
| `[` | Push state (save position and rotation) |
| `]` | Pop state (restore position and rotation) |

## Templates

VoxEdit comes with several built-in templates to get you started:

* **Simple Tree**: A basic tree structure that branches in 4 directions.
* **Dense Bush**: Short, wide, and bushy with many leaves.

## Usage

* **Select a Template**: Start by selecting a template from the dropdown menu to see how it works.
* **Modify Parameters**: Adjust the angle, length, and iterations to change the shape and size of the generated structure.
* **Edit Rules**: Add or modify rules to create custom branching patterns.
* **Adopt Dimensions**: Use the "Adopt Dimensions" button to automatically adjust the length and width parameters based on the current selection or volume size.
* **Generate**: Click "OK" to generate the voxel structure at the reference position.

> **Tip**: Use the `[` and `]` commands to create branching structures. `[` saves the current position and direction, allowing you to draw a branch, and `]` restores the saved state to continue from the branching point.
