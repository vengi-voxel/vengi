# Scene View

![voxedit-scene](../../img/voxedit-scene.png)

Here you can see all the nodes and their hierarchy in the scene. You can change the parents by using drag and drop and use a actions from the context menu for each nodes.

You can hide or show nodes from the viewport or lock them to execute some actions on all locked nodes at the same time.

It's also possible to use the play button to loop through all nodes in your scene. Make sure to check out the `Model animation speed` in the options menu to change the animation speed.

Next to these options you can create new nodes - e.g. __model__, __camera__ or __group__ nodes here.
