# Controls

There are different schemas available to pick from:

- Blender
- Magicavoxel
- Qubicle
- Vengi

See the binding editor in the menu bar to get a complete list of bindings or switch between the keymaps.

You can also manually edit the `keybindings-x.cfg` file in your user settings directory. Go to **About -> Paths**
and click the first entry. This will open your user settings directory for voxedit. The file is there if you at
least once quit the application.

You can also change the bindings in the console by using the `bind` command.

> Usage of the bind: `bind <modifier+key> <command> <context>`.
> `context` is one of `all`, `model`, `scene`, `editing` (`editing` is both `scene` and `model`)

To get a list of bindable commands, type the `cmdlist` command to the console and hit enter.
