# Configuration

## Variables

The engine can get configured by so called cvars (configuration variables). These variables can be modified from within
the game via key bindings, built-in console, the ui or scripts.

To get a list of supported cvars (they might differ from application to application), type the command `cvarlist` to the
built-in console - or execute the application with `--help` (Example: `vengi-voxedit.exe --help`).

The variables can get their initial value from various sources. The highest order is the command line. If you specify it on
the command line, every other method will not be used. If the engine finds the cvar name in your environment variables, this
one will take precedence over the one that is found in the configuration file. Next is the configuration file - this one will
take precedence over the default settings that are specified in the code.

The environment variable can be either lower case or upper case. For example it will work if you have `CL_GAMMA` or `cl_gamma`
exported. The lower case variant has the higher priority.

### Commandline

```bash
./vengi-voxvonvert -set voxformat_scale 2.0 [...]
```

### Environment

```bash
export VOXFORMAT_SCALE=2.0
./vengi-voxconvert [...]
```

## Configuration file

* Linux: `~/.local/share/vengi/voxconvert/voxconvert.vars`
* Windows: `C:/Users/bob/AppData/Roaming/vengi/voxconvert/voxconvert.vars`
* Mac: `/Users/bob/Library/Application Support/vengi/voxconvert/voxconvert.vars`

These folders not only contain the configuration file, but also the logs and other files that are created by the application. `log.txt` and `crash.txt` are the most important files that you can attach to a bug report.

## Search paths

You can get a list of search paths by calling the particular application with the `--help` parameter on the command line. This will print a list of search paths. You can even add your own paths by setting the cvar `core_path`.

> For packagers it might be interesting to set the `PKGDATADIR` cmake variable.

## Commands

To get a list of supported commands (they might differ from application to application), type the command `cmdlist` to the built-in console.

You can also get a list when doing `./vengi-app --help` on the command line.

## Key bindings

You can also modify or add key bindings to commands. Type `bindlist` to the console to get a list of the current active bindings
(and also here: they might differ from application to application). The command `bind` can be used to configure keybindings on-the-fly. These bindings are saved to a file on shutdown.

VoxEdit has an ui panel to show the configured keybindings - see [controls](voxedit/Controls.md) for more details.

## Logging

You can either log via syslog (on unix) or to stdout (this might of course differ from platform to platform).

The log level is configured by the `core_loglevel` variable. The lower the value, the more you see. `1` is the highest log level
(trace), where 5 is the lowest log level (error).

* `trace`: 1
* `debug`: 2
* `info`: 3
* `warn`: 4
* `error`: 5

## General

To get a rough usage overview, you can start any application with `--help`. It will print out the commands and configuration variables
with a description and hints how to modify/use them.

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cl_vsync`                    | enable or disable v-sync                                                                 |

## Voxel settings

A few cvars exists to tweak the export or import of several formats.

Some of these settings are only for voxel format, others are only for the mesh formats like ply, gltf, stl, fbx and obj.

| Name                          | Description                                                                              | Example      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `core_colorreduction`         | This can be used to tweak the color reduction by switching to a different algorithm. Possible values are `Octree`, `Wu`, `NeuQuant`, `KMeans` and `MedianCut`. This is useful for mesh based formats or RGBA based formats like e.g. AceOfSpades vxl. | Octree       |
| `palformat_maxsize`           | The maximum size of an image in x and y direction to quantize to a palette               | 512          |
| `palformat_rgb6bit`           | Use 6 bit color values for the palette (0-63) - used e.g. in C&C pal files               | true/false   |
| `voxel_meshmode`              | Set to 1 to use the marching cubes algorithm to produce the mesh                         | 0/1          |
| `voxformat_ambientocclusion`  | Don't export extra quads for ambient occlusion voxels                                    | true/false   |

| `voxformat_colorasfloat`      | Export the vertex colors as float or - if set to false - as byte values (GLTF/Unreal)    | true/false   |
| `voxformat_createpalette`     | Setting this to false will use use the palette configured by `palette` cvar and use those colors as a target. This is mostly useful for meshes with either texture or vertex colors or when importing rgba colors. This is not used for palette based formats - but also for RGBA based formats. | true/false   |
| `voxformat_emptypaletteindex` | By default this is `-1` which means that no color is skipped. Pick 0-255 to remove that palette index from the final saved file. **NOTE**: this only works for formats that don't force the empty voxel to be `0` or `255` (or any other index) already |
| `voxformat_fillhollow`        | Fill the inner parts of completely close objects, when voxelizing a mesh format. To fill the inner parts for non mesh formats, you can use the fillhollow.lua script. | true/false   |
