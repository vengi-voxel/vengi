# Welcome to vengi

This is a C++ voxel game engine and its tools. It includes a voxel editor with character animation support
and loading/saving into a lot of voxel volume formats. There are other tools like e.g. a thumbnailer for
your filemanager and a command line tool to convert between several voxel formats.

Find out more about features and status updates on my [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/MartinGerhardy).

The project source code is located at [github/mgerhardy/engine](https://github.com/mgerhardy/engine). We also
provide debian and windows binaries here.

If you just came here to use a voxel editor or to convert your voxel models into an obj or ply file,
you should just go to the [download page](https://github.com/mgerhardy/engine/releases) and check out
the documentation of the tool as given in the navigation bar.

If you came here as a developer, make sure to check out the [dependencies](Dependencies.md) and set up
your development environment. The build scripts are cmake based, so make sure to have it installed and
generate the project files for your desired ide. After setting up everything, make sure to check out
the [compilation](Compilation.md) guide.
