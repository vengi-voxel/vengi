# Setup commands

- compile: `make`
- run particular tests: `GTEST_FILTER=SomeTest.* make tests-yourmodulename-run`
- run all tests: `make tests`
- check the documentation under `docs` if your change would also require the documentation to be updated (or extended)

# Code style

- try to avoid the STL where possible! - no exceptions, no rtti, C-style casts.

# General

- when touching code, ensure that a test is written for it - if not, write one to test the change - and execute that test

# Logging

- when adding debug logging via `Log::debug()`, make sure to use the environment variable `CORE_LOGLEVEL=2` in front of your vengi applications or your `make` calls.

# Shaders

- the glsl shader C++ code is autogenerated by a tool called `shadertool` - see `docs/ShaderTool.md` for more details on how to use it. This is crucial when you are creating or updating shaders. The source code is in the build directory in a directory called `generated/shaders/<module>`. Also uniform data C++ structs are auto generated. You have to run `make` as described above each time you modify a shader.

# LUA Scripts

- more details on the lua scripts and the api can be found here: `docs/LUAScript.md` - if you are extending or modifying the api, make sure to also keep the documentation in sync.
